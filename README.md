# Web Scraper extension for schoology

## Overview

This project is intended to help me gather rubric scores from Schoology so that I can export them to students. Because Schoology does not expose the API for rubric scores, my students cannot see individual rubric row scores. By using a browser extension, I can gather that information programatically for each rubric and convert it into a format that I (and the student) can use.

v1 just simply dumps those scores into a CSV for an individual assignment that I will then email/copy to a shared drive for students. However, I'm actively looking for a way to automate this further. I also am looking to scrape the rubric comments as well.
