# Web Scraper extension for schoology

## Overview

This project is intended to help me gather rubric scores from Schoology so that I can export them to students. Because Schoology does not expose the API for rubric scores, my students cannot see individual rubric row scores. By using a browser extension, I can gather that information programatically for each rubric and convert it into a format that I (and the student) can use.

My v1 will just simply dump those scores into a text file for an individual assignment that I will then email/copy to a shared drive for students. However, I'm actively looking for a way to automate this further.
